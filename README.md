# AtashiTheorycraft

Yo, this is a project that will most likely never be completed. Basically it will hopefully become an application for simulating fights of any length for World of Warcraft 1.12.

To get it up and running do the following:

1. Make sure that you have Visual Studio installed (2015 and 2017 works fine, Community version works fine).
2. The default installation of Visual Studio should give you everything you need but otherwise get .NET 4.5.
3. Open AtashiTheorycraft.sln with Visual Studio.
4. Compile and run it with F5 (default key).
